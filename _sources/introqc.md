We can all agree that the computers today are more **powerful** than ever before. Our desktops, laptops and phones allow us to perform tasks quickly at the touch of a button. For most of us, these devices are much part of our daily lives - for our social communications, for commerce, for education and science, for our leisure and everything in between- and technologies are constantly evolving! There's always some upgrade, a new model phone with new features, or a software update, as technologists look for even better ways to carry out specific tasks. 

For scientists, computers are critical for mathematical calculations, modeling and simulations, in order to better our understanding of the natural world. Computers help us to find solutions to problems in science, engineering and medicine, *much* faster than we ever could without them.  The world's most powerful supercomputers are *right now* being used for weather forecasting and climate change prediction, seismic research, oil and gas exploration, cancer and biological research, pharmaceutical drug design and research, materials modelling, simulating fluid dynamics, virtual nuclear testing, data mining, training AIs and more. 

Yet within these research disciplines, there are still problems that we are not able to solve on the best of supercomputers *in any timely fashion*. Such problems are too large, too complex, having very many variables and so many possible outcomes, that it would take years upon years to compute their optimal solutions. **This is where the hope for Quantum Computing arises.**  

In this *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing*, we'll discover what Quantum Computing is all about, how we can access a quantum computer right from our own devices through the 'cloud' and even some basics in quantum programming.   

# Tips for Navigating this Book 

Before we continue, here are some tips for using this book.<br> 
&nbsp; 

The **buttons** on the *top right corner* of the page can enhance your learning experience in this book.<br>
- By clicking on the *box frame* button, you can enter **Fullscreen mode**.<br>
- By clicking on the *down arrow* button, you can download this book in pdf format.
- For those with Programming experience, feel free to connect to the GitHub repository or launch the book with *BinderHub*.
- Later on in the Quantum Programming tutorials, you may opt to run and edit the code for yourself by selecting the *rocket* button and clicking "**Live Demo**". If ever you mess up, you can always reload the page to reset. 


- If you encounter a word that you're not sure the meaning of, skip to the [Glossary](q-glossary). 
- And one last tip... There's **a lot** of content in this book, so take your time in digesting it. If you finish a section   today, you can always come back again tomorrow to do another one.
