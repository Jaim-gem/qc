    "From the [video](quantum-video), we learnt that **superposition** is when a quantum object can be in two or more different states at the same time. \n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify things, we looked at only two-level physical systems. Two-level systems have two possible **measurable states**. This means that when we observe or measure the system, we can get one of two posibilities. Technically, we can have a superposition of not just two states but as many as there are for that quantum system. \n",

    "Superposition is cool because it is a behaviour that is associated with waves, and so it is a direct reinforcement of the dual wave-particle nature of quantum objects.  \n",

    "Erwin Schrodinger posed an interesting *thought experiment* to illustrate the wonders of quantum superposition. The beginning of it goes something like this...\n",

    "Imagine you have a cat in a box.&nbsp; It's a *quantum cat*, obviously.<br>\n",
    "Well, Quantum Mechanics states that the cat can be in a superposition of more than one state at the same time.<br>\n",
    "The cat being alive or dead is the perfect example of a two-level system by the way. The cat can either be in the *alive* state or it can be in the *dead* state.<br>\n",
