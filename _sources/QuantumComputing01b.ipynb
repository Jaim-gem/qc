    "And what is *Quantum Information*?&nbsp; To put it simply, **Quantum Information** is the information presented by the **state** of a quantum object or system. \n",

    "From [Quantum vs Classical](quantum-versus), we learnt that a **state** is simply a description of something.\n",
    "Just as the state of a *classical* bit can be `0` or `1`, the state of a qubit may also be described.&nbsp; The *symbol* used to denote the state of a qubit is this: &nbsp;  $|\\Psi\\rangle$ . &nbsp; This is the Greek letter *Psi* (*...the 'p' is silent*). \n",

    "\n",
    "The most general way to describe the state of a qubit is as a superposition of the state \"0\" and the state \"1\". \n",
    "\n",
    "In Quantum Mechanics, we represent the state \"0\" as $|0\\rangle$ and the state \"1\" as $|1\\rangle$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can then write the state of a qubit as: \n",

    "$$\n",
    "|\\Psi\\rangle= \\alpha|0\\rangle + \\beta|1\\rangle \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$?&nbsp; *Alpha* written as $\\alpha$ is the first letter in the Greek alphabet, whereas *beta* written as $\\beta$ is the second letter. \n",
    "\n",
    "With regards to qubits, $\\alpha$ is a number that tells *how much* of the qubit is in state $|0\\rangle$, annd $\\beta$ is a number that tells *how much* of the qubit is in state $|1\\rangle$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For example**, if a qubit is *entirely* in the state $|1\\rangle$, then $\\beta=1$, which makes $\\alpha=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are not usually ordinary numbers like what we are familiar with, i.e. 0,1,2,3... They are what we call **complex** numbers, or **imaginary** numbers. Complex numbers are the most general types of numbers and we can use these numbers to represent things in *multiple dimensions* (...instead of the ordinary one-dimensional number line), and to give information on *angles*. \n",

    "If you wish to learn more about complex numbers, there's an excellent video series by *Welch labs* on YouTube that you can check out: [Imaginary Numbers Are Real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T647CGsuOVU) \n",

    "\n",
    "**For example**, if a qubit is in the state  $|0\\rangle$, it points to the *north pole* or to the top of the Bloch sphere. Since the north pole is always the starting point, the two angles needed to make the qubit point in that direction are both $0^\\circ$. \n",
