    "Whether it was his idea or not, he was *one of the first people* to put forward **the idea of a quantum mechanical device for simulating quantum mechanical things**, since it was already so difficult to use classical computation for simulating large quantum mechanical systems (*and it still is...*).\n",

    "**Just think about it...** How much *information* a singular qubit holds by simply having the property of **superposition**. This *drastically increases* the **computational space** for the working of our problems, making qubit calculations way more efficient for solving **hard problems**. \n",

From there, we will be able to know what molecules we can create for a particular purpose, **and so on...** \n",

    "In *Biology*, understanding the relationship between the structure of *proteins*, [how they fold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm-3kovWpNQ), their functions and roles in the human body are fundamental.
